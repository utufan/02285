- Corridor and Target Symmetry
- CBS might be a viable option to this domain given the number of agents we are dealing with

CBS
- Each agent finds the path of nodes from their start position to a box identified as a priority move
- Calculate the Box to the Goal for distance in terms of vertices
- Check if the path to the box is blocked by an agent or box
- If blocked, find the agent that can move the box and move it
- Take the paths from the agent searches and find conflicts
